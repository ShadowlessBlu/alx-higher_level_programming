**Networking Tasks with cURL in Bash:

Sent HTTP requests using curl in Bash scripts to interact with a server set up on a container.
Completed various tasks such as retrieving the size of the response body, handling different HTTP methods, sending headers and parameters, and checking status codes.
Algorithm Challenge in Python:

**Implemented a Python function named find_peak to find a peak element in a list of unsorted integers.
Utilized a binary search approach to efficiently locate the peak element.
Provided the function definition along with an example usage.
Each task in the summary is accompanied by a brief description of its objective and implementation details. Additionally, the summary outlines the tools and technologies used (such as curl for networking tasks and Python for the algorithm challenge) and highlights the diversity of skills demonstrated in the project, including scripting in Bash and algorithmic problem-solving in Python.
